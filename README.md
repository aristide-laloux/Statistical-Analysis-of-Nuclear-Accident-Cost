# Statistical Analysis of Nuclear Accident Cost

This repository contains a statistical analysis of the costs of nuclear accidents prior to the Three Mile Island incident on March 28, 1979. The analysis was conducted as part of a project for the MDI220 Statistics course (2022 â€“ 2023). The project focuses on modeling the cost distribution, estimating key parameters, and conducting hypothesis testing using real-world data.

## Project Overview

This analysis focuses on three key areas:

- **Statistical Modeling**: Examined the fit of Gaussian and Exponential distributions to the data, using Q-Q plots and discussed the results.
- **Point Estimation**: Computed maximum likelihood estimates, analyzed estimators' efficiency, and compared the risks associated with different estimators.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Tested hypotheses about the expected cost of an accident, calculated p-values, conducted power analysis, and applied the Central Limit Theorem for further testing.

This work demonstrates a comprehensive statistical approach to understanding the financial impact of nuclear accidents.
